# Movie Web Page
This web page is a course project for a web technologies class. This web page is movie-themed and allows users to view movies and tv shows from a database. The frontend was designed using the Angular framework with Bootstrap. The backend was built using NodeJS and Express. Both the frontend and backend were hosted on separate Google Cloud web servers. 

The frontend of the web page was developed to meet a set of functional specifications which included:
* Displaying popular movies and tv shows
* Querying the movie database for items using standard search functionality
* Getting additional details for movies and shows, including cast, reviews, trailers, related media
* Links for sharing on social media or accessing related sites
* Saving, editing, and displaying favorited media items
* Various animations, sliders, scrollable lists
* etc.

The backend of the app interfaced with the TMDB api.
